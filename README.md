## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CUBE CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project, I continued working with **utility classes** and began learning about the **CUBE CSS methodology**. It's still very new to me, so keep your expectations low.

**I also learned...**

- ... that `margin-inline` & `margin-block` (or padding) is a thing. I'm never going back to just margin!

- ... about the **visually-hidden** class. I still don't fully understand all of the attributes though.

- ... a little more about how to write accessible code.

### Continued development

I want to continue to develop and learn about the **CUBE CSS methodology** and understand how I can make my websites **as accessible as possible**.
